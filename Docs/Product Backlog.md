## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### 📋 TODO Items Identified


#### 2. Route Structure Cleanup
- **Issue**: `/` and `/b2c` routes are identical, causing confusion
- **Current State**: Both routes render the same `<Index />` component
- **Recommendation**: Remove `/b2c` route, use `/` as single homepage
- **Impact**: Cleaner routing structure and better UX
- **Status**: ⏳ Documented for implementation
- **Files to Update**:
  - `src/App.tsx` (remove duplicate `/b2c` route)
  - Update any hardcoded `/b2c` references in components

#### 3. Homepage Purpose Clarification
- **Issue**: Homepage should be optimized for guest visitors to learn about Jenga Biz
- **Current State**: Index page shows authenticated user features immediately
- **Recommendation**: Enhance Index page to serve dual purpose:
  - **For Guests**: Information about Jenga Biz platform, features, benefits
  - **For Authenticated Users**: Quick access to dashboard and core features
- **Status**: ⏳ Needs design review and implementation
- **Consideration**: May need conditional rendering based on authentication state

### 🚀 Cache Optimization Strategy
- **Status**: ✅ Complete - Comprehensive guide created
- **Location**: `Docs/CacheOptimizationGuide.md`
- **Impact**: Performance improvements for data-heavy operations
- **Key Features**:
  - TanStack Query optimization with persistence
  - Query-specific cache strategies
  - React memoization enhancements
  - Background refetching for critical data
  - Performance monitoring tools

---

## Implementation Priority Update

### 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIXES (This Week)
1. **Duplicate pages in Routes / and /b2c** - / and /b2c pages are the same 
with / intended to be landing/homepage this is page should be updated to be for guests that are viewing the site for the first time and should be able to view info about jenga biz and register as an entrepreneur
2. **Enhance Homepage for Guests** - Add informational content about Jenga Biz
3. **Update Documentation** - Reflect current state accurately

### 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY (Core Business - Unchanged)
1. **Subscription Management System** - Essential for B2C revenue generation
2. **Paystack Payment Gateway** - Critical for African market payment processing
3. **Cohort Management Interface** - Essential for B2B ecosystem builders
4. **Impact Reporting Dashboard** - Critical for demonstrating program ROI

---

## Conclusion

The Jenga Biz Africa platform has a **strong technical foundation** and **excellent B2C (entrepreneur) features** that exceed the basic PRD requirements. However, **critical B2B (ecosystem builder) functionality** is missing, which limits its value for accelerators, incubators, and funding organizations.

**Priority should be given to implementing cohort management and impact reporting** to achieve full PRD compliance and enable the platform to serve both entrepreneurs and ecosystem builders effectively.

The existing codebase provides an excellent foundation for adding these missing features, and the development team has demonstrated strong technical capabilities in the implemented components.
