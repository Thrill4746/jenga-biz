## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

### Immediate Next Steps (Ready to Execute)

1. **Apply Database Migration**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Deploy Edge Functions to Staging**
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy --project-ref staging-ref --no-verify-jwt
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set SUPABASE_URL=your_url --project-ref staging-ref
   supabase secrets set SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key --project-ref staging-ref
   # ... other secrets
   ```

4. **Run Smoke Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:smoke -- --env=staging
   ```

5. **Deploy to Production** (after staging validation)
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy --project-ref prod-ref --no-verify-jwt
   ```

### Component Migration Path

The infrastructure is ready. Frontend components can now be migrated individually:

**Phase 1: High-Impact Components**
1. **UserManagement.tsx** - Replace direct DB calls with `useEdgeAuth` hook
2. **FinancialTracker.tsx** - Use `useEdgeFinancial` for all financial operations

**Phase 2: Remaining Components**
3. Update `useAuth.tsx` to use edge functions
4. Migrate other components with direct database access
5. Remove unused Supabase client code
